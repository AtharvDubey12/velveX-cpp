# velveX-cpp

a C++ Translation and improvement to previous Python based program, VelveX (Custom LaTeX Syntax Parser).

To use velveX via web inteface, launch 'server.js' via command 'npm i' and 'node server.js' and then, visit the given localhost address on the terminal. 


VelveX is a powerful recursion based source to source compiler that converts valid Velvet syntax to its corresponding LaTeX syntax, that can be used to render maths. 


Velvet is a highly intuitive and compact syntax when compared with LaTeX. Velvet especially shines when writing long sequences of code, on average requiring about half the code you would need to write in LaTeX to accomplish the same task. Paired up with its easy learning curve, Velvet becomes a great way to writing digital math, quickly and with ease.

Note for Windows Users:
before hosting server, change the execution file from 'parser' to 'parser.exe'.

The project is live at: velvex.onrender.com
